# Final Capstone
â€‹
This is the final capstone project my team and I created for the Tech Elevator bootcamp.  We were assigned with making a website that reccommends movies based on genre preference.  The front end was built using Vue.js and we took a lot of inspiration from Netflix in terms of the aesthetic.  The backend was written in Java using the Springboot Framework connected to a Postgres database.
